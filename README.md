## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

**Good** :

"power": "Deliver puns so awful they deal psychic damage."

2) If you want to add a new function, have NEW in the name with a desciption in the comment. You can also Update the Lore.txt file with a description to help others to understand your way of thinking.
